# EVESqlToMdb _(Binaries / Setup)_

Current version: __1.0.26__

There's only one component _(MSComCtl.OCX)_ in EVESqlToMdb that requires a real installation to take place. Therefore I suggest you try the single EXE first. 
If that complains about missing MSComCtl.OCX, do the setup instead.

The ZIPs only include the corresponding EXE, in case you can't download EXE files directly.
